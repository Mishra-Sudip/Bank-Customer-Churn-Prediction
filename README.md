## Problem Statement

The dataset contains information like personal information of the customer, transaction information and bank information belonging to a bank.
It is often necessary to predict when the customers are going to withdraw their money from the bank account and stay dormant. 
If we are able to predict this, the bank can take necessary action to prevent customers from withdrawing huge sums of money and stay an active customer.
Our task is to be able to predict the customers who are going to churn based on the information given.
